# TantoCuoreFunnel

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.6.

This project is the utilitous little sister to Tanto Cuorse Randomizer. This accepts new cards into it's front end and writes them to it's internal database. The database is then able to be opened to localhost and used for Tanto Cuore Randomizer to ping off of and retrieve the data it expects. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Backend Server

Run `npm start server` to expose the databse.json to  `http://localhost:5000/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
